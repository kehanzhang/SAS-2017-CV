PROBLEM: This program requires you to take a string of digits and form a sequence of

numbers from that string. The numbers in the sequence are in increasing order and they are

formed as follows: The first digit of the input string, called it d, indicates that the first number in

the sequence is d digits long and comes from the following d digits in the input string. Each of

the subsequent numbers in the output sequence must have the least value possible while still

being greater than the number before it. These digits will come from the end of the input string,

taking digits from right to left in the order that they appear.

Consider the input string 1314159265. The first digit, a 1, indicates that the first integer in the

sequence will be one digit in length; it always come from the left side of the string. Thus, the 3

is the first number in the sequence. The next numbers in the sequence come from the right side

of the input string (i.e., consider the digits 5, 6, 2, 9, 5, 1, 4, and 1, in that order. The 5 is added

because it is larger than the 3. Next, the 6 is added. The next digit is a 2 but it is not larger than

6, so it is combined with the next digit, a 9, to form the number 29. The number 29 is larger than

6, so 29 is added to the output sequence. Next, 51 is added to the output sequence. The

remaining digits combine to form 41, but it is not added to the output sequence because it is not

larger than 51. Thus, the output sequence from 1314159265 is 3, 5, 6, 29, and 51, in that order.

INPUT: There will be 5 lines of input. Each will contain a string of digits. Its length will be at

least 2 and no more than 20.

OUTPUT: The numbers in the sequence formed as described above, separated by a single space.

A number can’t start with a leading 0.
